Major overhaul of visionctl agent system with improved LLM interaction, better error handling, and comprehensive logging

## Summary of Changes

### Core Improvements
1. **Comprehensive Logging System**
   - Added `tracing` crate to both `inputctl` and `visionctl`
   - Replaced all `eprintln!` calls with structured logging (info, debug, warn, error, trace)
   - Added verbose/quiet flags to CLI for log level control
   - Log levels: error (quiet), warn (default), info (verbose), debug (very verbose), trace (most verbose)

2. **Agent System Redesign**
   - Complete rewrite of agent planning and execution logic
   - Better error handling with automatic replanning when tools fail
   - Added scene notes for tracking UI state across iterations
   - Improved cursor position tracking with grid metadata
   - Better tool call management with proper ID tracking

3. **Tool System Improvements**
   - Replaced template matching tools with icon-based tools
   - `move_to_cell` now supports optional pixel offsets for precision
   - Added `scene_note` tool for documenting UI state
   - Added `stuck` tool for indicating when agent needs help
   - Improved `move_to_icon` to automatically move cursor to found icons
   - Better tool response handling with cursor status feedback

4. **Code Quality**
   - Removed debug print statements throughout codebase
   - Added proper error handling for all tool calls
   - Better state management in agent execution loop
   - Improved message history tracking

### Technical Details

**Agent System:**
- Grid cells now 200x200 pixels (was 50x50) for better targeting
- Automatic replanning when tools fail
- Better cursor position tracking with grid metadata
- Improved tool response handling with cursor status

**LLM Client:**
- Better tool call ID management for Ollama compatibility
- Improved message formatting for OpenAI API
- Better error handling for tool responses

**Detection System:**
- Replaced template matching with icon-based detection
- Better confidence scoring and candidate selection
- Improved debug output (now trace-level logging)

### Files Modified

**inputctl:**
- Cargo.toml: Added tracing dependency
- src/lib.rs: Added comprehensive logging to servo control and smooth movement

**visionctl:**
- Cargo.toml: Added tracing and tracing-subscriber dependencies
- src/agent.rs: Complete rewrite of agent logic with better error handling
- src/bin/visionctl.rs: Added verbose/quiet flags and logging initialization
- src/config.rs: Added logging for config parsing errors
- src/detection/mod.rs: Replaced debug prints with trace logging
- src/llm/client.rs: Improved tool call ID handling for Ollama
- src/llm/tools.rs: Replaced template tools with icon tools
- src/primitives/grid.rs: Added grid metadata for better cursor tracking
- src/primitives/mod.rs: Added pixel_to_grid conversion function
- src/actions/mod.rs: Added move_to_pixel export

### Breaking Changes

1. Template matching tools have been replaced with icon-based tools
2. Grid cell size changed from 50x50 to 200x200 pixels
3. Tool names changed: `move_to` → `move_to_cell`, `find_template` → `move_to_icon`
4. Tool behavior changed: `click_template` removed, `move_to_icon` now moves cursor instead of clicking

### Testing Notes

All changes have been tested with:
- Basic agent execution
- Smooth mouse movement with servo control
- Cursor position tracking
- LLM tool calling with proper error handling
- Logging at different verbosity levels

The changes maintain backward compatibility where possible but introduce significant improvements to the agent's ability to handle errors and recover from failures.
